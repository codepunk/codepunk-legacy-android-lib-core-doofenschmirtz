/**
 * <p>
 * Class that manages and supplies plugins based on supplied criteria. This criteria may or may
 * not change over the lifecycle of the app; therefore it is good practice to always using the
 * {@link PluginManager#get(Object)} method each time you need to reference a plugin rather than
 * saving the returned value. Upon calling {@link PluginManager#get(Object)}, PluginManager
 * will automatically determine if a new plugin needs to be created based on the given criteria.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Plugins allow you to avoid multiple <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> or <code>switch</code>
 * statements to perform certain behaviors based on a set of criteria. This can range from logging
 * information only if running in a development environment, or performing a certain action only
 * if a user is logged in, showing extra controls if the user has admin rights, showing a
 * "what's new" dialog the first time the app is run after an upgrade, or showing a special screen
 * if it is a user's birthday.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As an example, suppose you wanted to show an encouraging message when someone used the app on a
 * Monday. You could easily include an <code>if</code> statement to accomplish this. But imagine
 * that you also wanted to change the background color on Mondays, and add an extra button that
 * was only visible on Mondays, or show a different message on Friday, and so on. Soon your code
 * would be littered with <code>if</code> statements testing the day of the week.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You could instead set up a Monday PluginManager:
 * <pre>
 *
 * interface DayPlugin {
 *     fun showGreeting(context: Context)
 * }
 *
 * class BaseDayPlugin: DayPlugin {
 *     override fun showGreeting(context: Context) {
 *         // No action
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * class MondayPlugin: DayPlugin {
 *     override fun showGreeting(context: Context) {
 *         Toast.makeText(
 *                 context,
 *                 "Looks like someone has a case of the Mondays!",
 *                 Toast.LENGTH_LONG)
 *                 .show()
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * class DayPluginManager: PluginManager<DayPlugin, Calendar>() {
 *     override fun isPluginStale(state: Calendar?): Boolean {
 *         return isMonday(activeState) != isMonday(state)
 *     }
 *
 * override fun newPlugin(state: Calendar?): DayPlugin {
 *         return if (isMonday(state)) MondayPlugin() else BaseDayPlugin()
 *     }
 *
 * private fun isMonday(calendar: Calendar?): Boolean {
 *         return calendar?.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK) == Calendar.MONDAY
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the above example, we created a <code>DayPlugin</code> with a single method,
 * <code>showGreeting</code>. In the example mentioned previously, we could have also
 * included a "<code>setBackgroundColor</code>" method, and so on. Since the current date/time
 * is constantly changing, we pass that along with each call to {@link PluginManager#get}.
 * PluginManager in turn calls {@link PluginManager#isPluginStale(Calendar)} and
 * {@link PluginManager#newPlugin(Calendar)} as appropriate to determine whether the existing
 * plugin (if any) is "stale" and a new one needs to be created.
 * </p>
 * <p>To make use of this new plugin, we can code something like the following in an Activity:
 * <pre>
 * override fun onStart() {
 *   super.onStart()
 *   DayPluginManager().get(Calendar.getInstance()).showGreeting(this)
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is, of course, a rough example but it shows the power of using PluginManagers. Note that we
 * have avoided <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> or <code>switch</code> statements in our
 * <code>MainActivity</code> class, which makes for cleaner and more modular code. Another benefit
 * is that if you are testing a new feature, that feature can be implemented as a plugin. If
 * at any time you want to remove that feature entirely, it becomes much easier because it is
 * completely contained in its own plugin class and the calling class (in this case, MainActivity)
 * doesn't need to be modified, or even aware that the plugin was removed.
 * </p>
